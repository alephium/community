By design Alephium is public, open and decentralized. However, true decentralization can only be achieved if the community is involved at every level of the project, from mining to development but also content creation as well as project awareness initiatives. This is why it is paramount to encourage community contributions and involvement to foster the healthy growth of Alephiumâ€™s ecosystem.

This repository will aggregate all relevant resources for community contribution to the project.
