## Community Reward Program Rules

This is an experimental and discretionary rewards program for our active Alephium community to encourage and reward those who are contributing and helping to improve the Alephium platform, ecosystem and community. It is not a competition. 
Alephium considers a number of variables in determining rewards. Determinations of eligibility, score and all terms related to a reward are at the sole and final discretion of Alephium.

- Participants are responsible for all taxes. 
- All rewards are subject to applicable law. 
- Participants' contributions must not violate any law or compromise any data that is not theirs.
- Participants take part in this program at their own risk and expense. 
- Participants will be asked to sign a simple contract with their name and physical address before receiving the reward. Failure to do so will result in forfeiture of the reward.
- Participants are responsible for notifying Alephium of any changes to their contact information. Failure to do so may lead to the forfeiture of any rewards participants may become eligible for and receive.

Alephium reserves the right to discontinue the Program at any time without notice.
