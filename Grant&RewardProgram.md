# Community Grants & Reward Program

We’d like to introduce you to the first iteration of the Alephium Community reward program. 
It is composed of 3 pillars: Development Bounties, Engagement Rewards & Special “Events” rewards.
Rewards are meant to be distributed at the end of each month from the Ecosystem Development allocation. Although the exact moment of each distribution may vary according to workload. The project is young and a lot has to be learned by doing, one thing that is certain is that such a program needs a certain degree of dynamic and will evolve through time. The first distribution will happen this month. 

Some of our community’s contributions can be found in the [Awesome Alephium repository](https://github.com/alephium/awesome-alephium), you are welcome to add yours!

## Grants

Alephium is only as good as its ecosystem. In order to support the development of 3rd-party dApps and other inititiatives contributing to the growth of the Alephium Ecosystem, we offer the possibility to request grants. To apply for a grant, please send a fully detailed proposal to [grant@alephium.org](grant@alephium.org).

## Development Rewards & Bounties

At this stage of the project, development is the cornerstone of Alephium’s success, therefore development rewards & bounties are not capped. 
Rewards are assigned to GitHub Issues and Pull Requests proposed by community members in any of the project [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/alephium/repositories). In addition, we’ll add “bounty” topics or tasks where community support is welcomed in the Community repository. 
Generally, Pull Requests are rewarded once merged, but issues can be rewarded at creation. Each reward is assessed individually and may differ from the general rule. 

## Engagement Rewards
Community engagement is very important and can consist of many things, big or small. Documentation is one example, sustained quality technical support on Discord is another. The total monthly reward amount that is distributed is capped and recompenses the community members with the most helpful contributions. 

## Special "Events" Rewards
These rewards are linked to specific “events” as well as unforeseen interactions leading to some kind of remarkable progress or positive impact on the project. These rewards will also be distributed at the end of the month in which the event took place. A past example of this could be providing great assistance or feedback during one of our online testnet install events. Another example could be running a miner on the testnet for a sustained period of time.
