## Community Grants & Reward Program

The Alephium Community Grants & Reward Program is meant to encourage and incentivize contributions to the Alephium project and its ecosystem. Some of our community’s existing contributions can be found in the [Awesome Alephium repository](https://github.com/alephium/awesome-alephium) and you are welcome to add yours!


### Grants

In order to support the development of and growth of the Alephium Ecosystem, we offer the possibility to request grants. We are open to funding anything that improves the Alephium ecosystem, so if you or your team are developing a project leveraging Alephium you can apply for a grant and we’ll be happy to help fund your work. 

#### What kind of projects do you fund?
We love DeFi dApps, NFT platforms, decentralized services, integrations, hardware, etc…

#### I have an Idea, how do I apply?
Please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/PDJZwxAVKGRBEgdw9) with all info, and we’ll get back to you. Give us a bit of time too as we solicit the relevant parties inside Alephium. 

#### What are the rules? How does it work?
1. Submit your application & documentation[^1]
2. We will reach out for interviews if your application is deemed a good fit
3. We will notify you if your application is accepted (or not)
4. Grantees onboarded!

[^1]: Please submit one document with the full proposal. Your submission document  should include at minimum: your team, what you are looking to achieve, how you plan on achieving it, the project timeframe, the grant value desired and milestones). 

### Community Rewards

We are always amazed at the support we’re getting from our community, whether it’s in development, community services, awareness and promotion! Help us see your work, and within our possibilities, we’ll reward some of you every month! We support three types of contributions: Development Contributions and Engagement Contributions. \
 \
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How are Development Contributions rewarded?</span> We love dev contributions! Rewards are assigned to GitHub Issues and Pull Requests proposed by community members in any of the project [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/alephium/repositories). You do not need to apply, we’ll select the awardees directly from GitHub. \
 \
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How are Engagement Contributions rewarded?</span> You don’t need to be technical or a dev to be rewarded. There are many other contributions we value too: community engagement, translations of documentation, blog post explainers, podcasts, videos, visuals and others! If you did something awesome with/for Alephium, let us know through [this form](https://forms.gle/dVCFvn6PuP56oU3K8)!

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How do rewards work and what are the rules?</span> Each month, we review internally all contributions submitted and allocate rewards. Each contribution is assessed individually. Rewards are paid in ALPH. [Find more info and the rules here.](https://github.com/alephium/community/blob/master/RewardProgramRules.md)
