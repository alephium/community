# Grant & Reward Program Rules
These rules may be subject to change in the near or distant future and read as the following:

This is an experimental and discretionary program for our active Alephium community to support and reward those who are contributing and helping to improve and grow the Alephium network, ecosystem and community. 
Alephium considers a number of variables in determining grants and rewards. Determinations of eligibility, score, and all terms related to a grant or reward are at the sole and final discretion of Alephium.

- Participants are responsible for all taxes. 
- All rewards and grants are subject to applicable law. 
- Participants' contributions must not violate any law or compromise any data that is not theirs.
- Participants take part in this program at their own risk and expense. 
- Participants will be asked to sign a simple contract with their name and physical address before receiving the reward or grant. Some participants may be asked to complete further KYC procedures at the discretion of Alephium. Failure to do so will result in forfeiture of the reward or grant.
- Participants are responsible for notifying Alephium of any changes to their contact information. Failure to do so may lead to the forfeiture of any rewards or grants participants may become eligible for and receive.

Alephium reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Program at any time without notice.
