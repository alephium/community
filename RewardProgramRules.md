# Grant & Reward Program Rules
These rules may be subject to change in the near or distant future and read as the following:

This is an experimental and discretionary program for our active Alephium community to support and reward those who are contributing and helping to improve and grow the Alephium network, ecosystem and community. 
Alephium considers a number of variables in determining grants and rewards. Determinations of eligibility, score, and all terms related to a grant or reward are at the sole and final discretion of Alephium.

- Participants are responsible for all taxes. 
- All rewards and grants are subject to applicable law. 
- Participants' contributions must not violate any law or compromise any data that is not theirs.
- Participants take part in this program at their own risk and expense. 
- In accordance with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and sanction screening regulations, Alephium may require verification of the participant’s identity and background. This may include the collection and processing of personal data for identification and compliance purposes. The Recipient will be notified of any such requirements and must provide the necessary information in a timely manner. Failure to do so may result in delay or refusal of the reward or Grant.
- Participants are responsible for notifying Alephium of any changes to their contact information. Failure to do so may lead to the forfeiture of any rewards or grants participants may become eligible for and receive.

Alephium reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Program at any time without notice.
